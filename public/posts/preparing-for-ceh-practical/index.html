I have always been interested in Pen-testing but it hasn&rsquo;t been my day job yet. Avoiding the Certs vs. skills discussion, I want to acquire 1-2 basic pen-testing certs to round out my profile in Cyber Security. Considering that, last year I applied for EC-Council&rsquo;s CEH scholarship and received the scholarship and I must appear for the practical exam within 1-year. Since then it has been 3-4 months without any progress on the preparation.">
