Youâ€™ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>
<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>
<p><code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>
<p>Where <code>YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code>MONTH</code> and <code>DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code>MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>
<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">print_hi</span>(name)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hi, </span><span style="color:#e6db74">#{</span>name<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print_hi(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Tom&#39;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#=&gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home">Jekyll docs</a> for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo</a>.
