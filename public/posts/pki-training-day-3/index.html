<p>PKCS# 10: Certificate Request Standard:
Creation of Certificate Signing Request is created in compliance of this Standard. The created file is in .csr format.
Important things in the CSR includes, Public Key of the requestee and information of the subject.
Note: For subject sending the CSR, it is necessary to sign the information in CSR request to sign using its private key, to ensure the ownership of the private key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PKCS# 11: Cryptoki:
A standard to define platform independent API for communication with the HSM.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is recommended, to not store secret data (private asymmetric key or secret(symmetric) keys) in software, but store in a secure hardware known as Hardware Security Module (HSM). The HSMs contain
For personal use, USB tokens or Smartcards are available.
The storage in smart cards can contain upto 16kb and a certificate averages at about 1kb.
There are two user modes in HSMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin</li>
<li>User</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>PKCS# 12 Personal Information Exchange Syntax standard
It is recommended for user to generate the private key. But there exists a possibility to acquire an already generated key pair from another entity. In such cases, .p12 or .pfx file is used along with password to securely contain private key.</li>

<li>.crl:</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="certificate-revocation-list-crl">Certificate Revocation List (CRL):</h2>
<p>In cases, where a certificate is invalidated before its endlife, such certificates are included in the Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Revocation is performed by the Certificate Serial No. instead of its public keys.</p>
<h2 id="crl-publishing">CRL Publishing:</h2>
<p>The Revocation Status of all certificates are published via CRL that is shared as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</li>
<li>HTTP</li>
</ul>
<p>All certificates have their expiry date included in its fields. CRLs only contain the certificates which aren&rsquo;t expired yet and only revoked. All those certificates that have expired are excluded from the CRL.
RFC 5280 suggests the certificates, Certificate Authorities and Certificates</p>
<h3 id="large-crls">Large CRLs:</h3>
<p>The CRLs can grow quite huge (upto multiple MBs) and has issues to transfer and process such huge files. Following techniques are used as its solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delta CRL: Main CRL is published periodically (i.e. Monthly or Quarterly) and the incremental CRL is made available at a shorter frequency (i.e. Weekly). Consumer can cache the main CRLs and incremental CRLs can be fetched at requirement to process/check the certificate from CRL.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="online-certificate-status-protocol-ocsp">Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)</h2>
<p>RFC 6960
A lightweight alternative is used in the place of CRL downloading.
In this scenario, an OCSP Server is deployed to shift the processing of CRL from customer side to the server side.</p>
<p>OCSP responder respond all requests with its own Signature using HSM for hashing and Signing.
Usual Transaction Rate: around 2000 transactions per second</p>
<p>In such situations, an attack can reach till its OCSP gateway because usually WAF can&rsquo;t support ASN1 encoding. Therefore, an OCSP gateway is deployed to protect the internal zone.</p>
<p>Possible Responses of OCSP Server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Revoked</li>
<li>Unknown</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="trusted-communications-tlsssl">Trusted Communications (TLS/SSL)</h1>
<p>Secure a Server/Client communication,
SSL is enabled, provide a certificate (with private key), either by importing a .pfx file (including a key &amp; certificate) or generate a key pair locally.
A CSR is generated in the second case, for signing from the Certificate Authority. CSR contains the domain and information of the subject. CA has the responsibility to identify and vet the domain and other provided information. A certificate is generated by the CA and shared back to the subject.
Life of a SSL certificate is 389 days.</p>
<h2 id="communication-states">Communication States</h2>
<ol>
<li>At the first message between Client &amp; Server is a Client Hello message, which includes (SSL version, list of algorithms for both session key and asymmetric encryption, compression algorithms).</li>
<li>In response Server hello message is sent by the server (including the chosen most safe algorithm, compression, certificate of server).</li>
</ol>
<p>Hand shake completed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Following checks are performed at the Client end:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Check of Trust on Certificate and issuing CA</li>
<li>Check of Expiry is performed</li>
<li>Check of Domain &amp; Certificate link</li>
<li>Check for Revocation of the Certificate (optional)</li>

<li>Generate a symmetric key, encrypt at client&rsquo;s end by Public Key contained in Server&rsquo;s received certificate</li>

Following are the steps:</p>
<h2 id="time-stamping-protocol">Time Stamping Protocol</h2>
<p>For trusting the transactions, it is essential to assure a valid time stamp in all its transactions. A dedicated time appliance is used in the Public Key Infrastructure to ensure security of correct time in all transactions of CA.
Therefore, a Time Stamping Authority (TSA) Server is deployed for providing standard time. A TSA server has a deployed NTP Appliance (with a reference time from GPS via a Physical GPS antenna) in Hardware to provide an accurate time.
Additionally, an HSM is used to sign the Timestamp responses using TSA&rsquo;s private keys.</p>
